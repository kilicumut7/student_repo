# Problem 2: Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum

## Motivation

The forced damped pendulum exemplifies a nonlinear dynamical system with rich behavior due to the interplay of damping, restoring torque, and periodic external forcing. It transitions from simple harmonic oscillations to complex phenomena including resonance, quasi-periodicity, and chaos. Studying this system offers insights into physical, biological, and engineered systems subject to oscillatory forcing.

Key parameters include the damping coefficient, driving amplitude, and driving frequency. By varying these, one observes diverse behaviors—synchronized oscillations, resonance peaks, and chaotic motion. This makes the forced damped pendulum a canonical system for studying nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

The equation of motion for a forced damped pendulum is:

$$
\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d \theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \sin\theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

Where:

* $\theta(t)$ is the angular displacement,
* $\beta$ is the damping coefficient,
* $\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}$ is the natural frequency (with pendulum length $l$),
* $A$ is the amplitude of the external forcing,
* $\omega$ is the forcing frequency.

### Small-Angle Approximation

For small oscillations, $\sin \theta \approx \theta$, which linearizes the equation:

$$
\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{d \theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \theta = A \cos(\omega t)
$$

This is a linear, second-order differential equation describing a driven damped harmonic oscillator.

### Approximate Solutions and Resonance

The steady-state solution has the form:

$$
\theta(t) = \Theta \cos(\omega t - \delta)
$$

Where amplitude $\Theta$ and phase lag $\delta$ depend on $\beta, \omega_0, \omega, A$:

$$
\Theta = \frac{A}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (\beta \omega)^2}}
$$

$$
\tan \delta = \frac{\beta \omega}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}
$$

* Resonance occurs when the driving frequency $\omega$ is close to $\omega_0$, causing large oscillation amplitudes.
* Damping $\beta$ reduces the peak amplitude and broadens the resonance curve.

## 2. Analysis of Dynamics

* **Damping $\beta$:** Higher damping reduces amplitude and smooths dynamics.
* **Driving amplitude $A$:** Increasing $A$ can push the system into nonlinear and chaotic regimes.
* **Driving frequency $\omega$:** Varying $\omega$ reveals resonance peaks and complex behavior when $\omega$ approaches $\omega_0$.

Beyond small angles, the full nonlinear equation produces:

* Periodic oscillations,
* Quasiperiodicity,
* Chaotic motion (sensitive dependence on initial conditions).

## 3. Practical Applications

* **Energy harvesting:** Devices use forced oscillations to generate power.
* **Suspension bridges:** Understanding forced oscillations under wind loads.
* **Electrical circuits:** Driven RLC circuits analogously follow similar equations.
* **Biomechanics:** Gait and balance involve damped forced oscillations.

## 4. Implementation

Below is a Python simulation using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to numerically solve the nonlinear equation and plot the angular displacement over time.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

# Parameters
beta = 0.2          # damping coefficient
omega0 = 1.5        # natural frequency
A = 1.2             # driving amplitude
omega = 1.4         # driving frequency

def forced_damped_pendulum(t, y):
    theta, omega_dot = y
    dtheta_dt = omega_dot
    domega_dot_dt = -beta * omega_dot - omega0**2 * np.sin(theta) + A * np.cos(omega * t)
    return [dtheta_dt, domega_dot_dt]

# Initial conditions: theta=0, angular velocity=0
y0 = [0.0, 0.0]

# Time span
t_span = (0, 100)
t_eval = np.linspace(*t_span, 10000)

# Solve ODE
sol = solve_ivp(forced_damped_pendulum, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval)

# Plotting theta vs time
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(sol.t, sol.y[0])
plt.title('Forced Damped Pendulum: Angular Displacement over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Angle (radians)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

* **Poincaré sections:** Sample state at intervals $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ to analyze periodicity/chaos.
* **Bifurcation diagrams:** Show transition from periodic to chaotic behavior as parameters vary.
