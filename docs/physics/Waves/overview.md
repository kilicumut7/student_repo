Waves are disturbances that transfer energy through a medium (or even through empty space in the case of electromagnetic waves) without necessarily transferring matter. This section introduces the various types and properties of waves.

## Key Concepts
* Types of Waves (Transverse, Longitudinal)
* Wave Properties (Wavelength, Frequency, Amplitude, Speed)
* Wave Phenomena (Reflection, Refraction, Diffraction, Interference)
* Sound Waves and Light Waves
