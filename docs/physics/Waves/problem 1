To effectively analyze and visualize the interference patterns, I will follow these steps:

1.  **Select a Regular Polygon**: I will choose an equilateral triangle for simplicity and clear visualization.
2.  **Position the Sources**: I will calculate the coordinates of the vertices of the equilateral triangle for the placement of the three point sources.
3.  **Wave Equations**: I will write down the single disturbance equation for each of the three sources, accounting for their specific $(x_0, y_0)$ positions.
4.  **Superposition of Waves**: I will define a function that calculates $\eta_{sum}(x, y, t)$ by summing the individual wave equations.
5.  **Analyze Interference Patterns**: I will set `t=0` (or any constant `t`) to analyze the instantaneous pattern. Constructive interference occurs where $|\eta_{sum}|$ is maximum, and destructive interference where $|\eta_{sum}|$ is minimum (ideally zero).
6.  **Visualization**: I will create a 2D plot (heatmap or contour plot) of $\eta_{sum}(x, y, t)$ over a grid of $(x, y)$ points to show the interference pattern.

Let's proceed with the equilateral triangle.

### Problem 1: Interference Patterns on a Water Surface

#### Motivation

The phenomenon of wave interference is a cornerstone of wave physics, demonstrating how individual waves combine to form complex patterns of amplification and cancellation. On a water surface, this is visually compelling, as ripples from multiple sources interact to create regions of high and low displacement. By studying these patterns, we gain insight into fundamental wave properties like phase relationships and the principle of superposition, which are critical for understanding wave behavior in various physical contexts, from optics to quantum mechanics.

#### Problem Statement: Interference Patterns from Point Sources on a Regular Polygon

Our task is to analyze the interference patterns formed on a water surface due to the superposition of waves emitted from point sources placed at the vertices of a chosen regular polygon. We will specifically use an **equilateral triangle** for this analysis.

The displacement of a single circular wave from a point source at $(x_0, y_0)$ is given by:

$\eta(x,y,t) = \frac{A}{r} \cdot \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)$

where:
* $\eta(x,y,t)$ is the displacement at point $(x,y)$ and time $t$.
* $A$ is the amplitude of the wave.
* $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, with $\lambda$ being the wavelength.
* $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, with $f$ being the frequency.
* $r = \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the source.
* $\phi$ is the initial phase.

We will assume all sources emit waves with the same amplitude $A$, wavelength $\lambda$, and frequency $f$, and are coherent (maintaining a constant phase difference, which we'll set to zero for simplicity, $\phi=0$).

The principle of superposition states that the total displacement $\eta_{sum}(x,y,t)$ is the sum of individual wave displacements:

$\eta_{sum}(x,y,t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x,y,t)$

where $N$ is the number of sources. For an equilateral triangle, $N=3$.

#### Steps Followed:

1.  **Selected Regular Polygon**: Equilateral Triangle.
2.  **Position the Sources**:
    Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be $L$. We can place the center of the polygon at the origin $(0,0)$ for convenience.
    The vertices of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin with circumradius $R_c$ are:
    * $S_1 = (R_c \cos(90^\circ), R_c \sin(90^\circ)) = (0, R_c)$
    * $S_2 = (R_c \cos(210^\circ), R_c \sin(210^\circ)) = (-R_c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -R_c \frac{1}{2})$
    * $S_3 = (R_c \cos(330^\circ), R_c \sin(330^\circ)) = (R_c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -R_c \frac{1}{2})$

    The relation between side length $L$ and circumradius $R_c$ for an equilateral triangle is $L = R_c \sqrt{3}$. So, $R_c = L/\sqrt{3}$.
    Let's choose $L=2$ units for demonstration. Then $R_c = 2/\sqrt{3}$.

    Source coordinates:
    * $S_1 = (0, 2/\sqrt{3})$
    * $S_2 = (-1, -1/\sqrt{3})$
    * $S_3 = (1, -1/\sqrt{3})$

3.  **Wave Equations**:
    For each source $i$ at $(x_i, y_i)$, the displacement is:
    $\eta_i(x,y,t) = \frac{A}{r_i} \cdot \cos(kr_i - \omega t)$ (assuming $\phi=0$)
    where $r_i = \sqrt{(x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2}$.

4.  **Superposition of Waves**:
    $\eta_{sum}(x,y,t) = \frac{A}{r_1} \cos(kr_1 - \omega t) + \frac{A}{r_2} \cos(kr_2 - \omega t) + \frac{A}{r_3} \cos(kr_3 - \omega t)$

    For visualization, we will fix time $t=0$, so $\eta_{sum}(x,y,0) = A \left( \frac{\cos(kr_1)}{r_1} + \frac{\cos(kr_2)}{r_2} + \frac{\cos(kr_3)}{r_3} \right)$.
    Note: The $\frac{1}{r}$ amplitude decay factor is typically included for a more realistic point source in 2D. However, for visual clarity of interference patterns, it's often simplified to a constant amplitude, $A$, for the wave **at the source**, and the wave equation is simplified to $\eta(x,y,t)=A \cdot \cos(kr-\omega t+\phi)$. The problem statement includes $A/r$, so we will use it. If the patterns appear too faint far from sources, we might consider a small $r_0$ cutoff or a slightly different amplitude model. For now, we'll stick to the provided equation.

5.  **Analyze Interference Patterns**:
    * **Constructive Interference:** Occurs when the crests (or troughs) of all waves align, leading to maximum positive or negative displacement. This happens when the phase differences between waves are integer multiples of $2\pi$. For two waves from sources $S_i$ and $S_j$, constructive interference occurs when $|r_i - r_j| = m\lambda$, where $m$ is an integer.
    * **Destructive Interference:** Occurs when the crests of one wave align with the troughs of another, leading to minimum displacement (ideally zero). This happens when the phase differences are odd integer multiples of $\pi$. For two waves from sources $S_i$ and $S_j$, destructive interference occurs when $|r_i - r_j| = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$, where $m$ is an integer.
    With three sources, the patterns become more complex, involving multiple pairwise interference conditions simultaneously.

6.  **Visualization**: We'll use Matplotlib to generate a heatmap of $\eta_{sum}(x,y,0)$.

#### Detailed Explanation of the Interference Patterns Observed for an Equilateral Triangle

The generated plot displays the instantaneous displacement of the water surface at a fixed time ($t=0$). The color scale (red to blue) indicates the magnitude and sign of the displacement, with white/light gray representing zero displacement.

**Regions of Constructive Interference (Bright/Red Areas):**
These are the areas where the waves from all three sources arrive predominantly in phase. This means that the crests from one wave largely overlap with the crests of the other two waves (or troughs with troughs). In these regions, the individual displacements add up, leading to a maximum positive or negative total displacement ($\eta_{sum}$). On the plot, these appear as bright red (maximum positive displacement) or bright blue (maximum negative displacement) regions.

**Regions of Destructive Interference (Dark/White/Light Gray Areas):**
These are the areas where waves from the sources arrive significantly out of phase. For example, a crest from one wave might coincide with a trough from another, leading to cancellation. If perfect cancellation occurs, the net displacement is zero. On the plot, these appear as the white or lighter gray regions, often forming distinct lines or curves called "nodal lines" or "lines of destructive interference."

**General Observations for the Equilateral Triangle Pattern:**

1.  **Central Constructive Interference:** Due to the symmetry of the setup, the very center of the equilateral triangle (the origin, where the sources are placed symmetrically around) is a strong point of constructive interference. The distances from each source to the center are equal ($R_{circum}$), so the waves arrive perfectly in phase (assuming the same initial phase). This manifests as a prominent bright spot at the origin.

2.  **Symmetry of the Pattern:** The entire interference pattern inherits the rotational symmetry of the equilateral triangle. If you rotate the plot by 120 degrees, the pattern appears identical. This is a direct consequence of the symmetric placement of the sources and their identical wave properties.

3.  **Radial Fringes and Their Deformation:** Around each individual source, you can still discern remnants of the circular wave fronts. However, these circles are distorted and interact with the waves from the other two sources, creating complex overlapping patterns.

4.  **Complex Nodal and Antinodal Lines:**
    * **Nodal Lines (Destructive Interference):** These are the dark/light lines where the water surface remains relatively calm. For multiple sources, these lines form intricate curves that are not simply hyperbolas (as they would be for just two sources). They represent points where the path differences from the sources result in a net displacement of zero.
    * **Antinodal Regions (Constructive Interference):** These are the bright red and bright blue regions that radiate outwards from the center and the general vicinity of the sources. These areas form "lobes" where the wave energy is concentrated due to reinforcement.

5.  **Dependence on Wavelength and Source Spacing:**
    The scale and detail of the interference pattern are critically dependent on the ratio of the distance between sources to the wavelength ($\text{side\_length}/\lambda$).
    * If the wavelength is much smaller than the source spacing, the interference fringes will be much finer and more numerous.
    * If the wavelength is comparable to or larger than the source spacing, the pattern will be coarser, and distinct fringes may be harder to resolve.

This simulation clearly illustrates how the superposition principle leads to rich and intricate wave patterns, showcasing the fundamental wave behaviors of constructive and destructive interference for multiple coherent sources.
