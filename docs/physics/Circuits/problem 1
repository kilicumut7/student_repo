I will choose **Option 2: Advanced Task – Full Implementation** to provide a comprehensive solution for calculating equivalent resistance using graph theory.

### Problem 1: Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

#### Motivation

The concept of equivalent resistance is fundamental in electrical engineering, allowing us to simplify complex circuits into a single resistive element. While simple series and parallel combinations are straightforward, analyzing larger, more intricate networks can quickly become challenging with traditional iterative methods. Graph theory provides a powerful and elegant framework to model and solve such problems systematically.

By representing a circuit as a graph, where nodes are circuit junctions and edges are resistors (with weights corresponding to their resistance values), we can leverage graph algorithms to identify series and parallel connections and iteratively reduce the graph. This approach is not only computationally efficient for complex circuits but also aligns with the principles used in modern circuit simulation and analysis software. It highlights the interdisciplinary nature of physics, engineering, and computer science.

#### Task: Full Implementation of Equivalent Resistance Calculation Using Graph Theory

We will implement an algorithm that calculates the equivalent resistance between two specified nodes in a circuit represented as a graph. The algorithm will iteratively identify and simplify series and parallel connections until the circuit is reduced to a single equivalent resistance.

**Algorithm Description:**

The core idea is to iteratively simplify the graph by applying series and parallel reduction rules until only the two terminal nodes (input and output) remain, connected by a single equivalent resistor.

1.  **Represent the Circuit as a Graph:**
    * Nodes: Circuit junctions.
    * Edges: Resistors connecting junctions. Each edge has a weight representing its resistance value.

2.  **Iterative Reduction Process:**
    The algorithm repeatedly searches for and simplifies series and parallel connections until no more simplifications can be made, or the graph is reduced to a single edge between the terminals.

    * **Series Reduction:**
        * **Identification:** A series connection exists when two resistors (edges) are connected at a common node, and that node has a degree of exactly 2 (meaning only these two resistors are connected to it). In other words, current entering this node *must* pass through both resistors.
        * **Simplification:** Replace the two series resistors ($R_1$, $R_2$) with a single equivalent resistor $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2$. The common node is removed, and the new equivalent resistor connects the two outer nodes.

    * **Parallel Reduction:**
        * **Identification:** A parallel connection exists when two or more resistors (edges) connect the *same two* nodes.
        * **Simplification:** Replace the parallel resistors ($R_1$, $R_2, \dots, R_n$) with a single equivalent resistor $R_{eq} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{R_i}\right)^{-1}$. The original parallel resistors are removed, and the new equivalent resistor connects the same two nodes.

3.  **Handling Nested Combinations:**
    The iterative nature of the algorithm inherently handles nested combinations. When an inner series or parallel combination is reduced, it creates a new equivalent resistor. This new resistor can then become part of a larger series or parallel combination in subsequent iterations. The algorithm continues until no more direct series/parallel simplifications are found.

    * For example, in a bridge circuit, initially, there might not be simple series or parallel connections directly across the input terminals. However, if some components on the 'arms' of the bridge form a series or parallel combination, simplifying them will modify the graph, potentially revealing new series or parallel connections that were previously 'nested'.

4.  **Termination Condition:**
    The loop terminates when:
    * The graph consists of only the two specified terminal nodes connected by a single edge (the equivalent resistance).
    * No more series or parallel reductions can be found in an iteration, indicating that the circuit might contain more complex configurations (e.g., a pure Wheatstone bridge or more general complex networks without simple series/parallel components) that cannot be reduced by this specific algorithm. For such cases, more advanced techniques like Y-Δ (Wye-Delta) transformations or matrix methods (e.g., nodal analysis) are required. Our algorithm focuses on series/parallel reductions.

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode

    Initialize graph G with nodes and weighted edges (resistors)

                Let w = other_node_of(edge2, N)
                
                If u != w: # Ensure the two edges don't form a self-loop
                    Let R1 = resistance_of(edge1)
                    Let R2 = resistance_of(edge2)

                    made_a_reduction = True
                    Break # Restart the loop to re-evaluate graph structure
        
        If not made_a_reduction:
            Break # No more series or parallel reductions possible
            
    # --- Check Final Result ---
    If G has exactly one edge remaining and it connects terminal_A and terminal_B:
        Return resistance_of(that_single_edge)
    Else:
        Return "Circuit cannot be fully reduced by series/parallel rules."

#### Description of How it Handles Complex Circuit Configurations on Three Input Examples:

1.  **Simple Series-Parallel (Nested) Example:**
    * **Circuit:** `A --R1-- B --R2-- C` and `B --R3-- C` (R2 and R3 are in parallel). `C --R4-- D`.
    * **Terminals:** A and D.
    * **How it handles:**
        * **Iteration 1:** The `_simplify_parallel` method identifies that nodes `B` and `C` are connected by two parallel resistors (R2=20, R3=30). It calculates their equivalent resistance: $1 / (1/20 + 1/30) = 12 \Omega$. It then removes R2, R3, and adds a new resistor of $12 \Omega$ between `B` and `C`. `made_reduction` is True.
        * **Iteration 2:** The loop restarts. Now, node `B` has a degree of 2 (connected to `A` by R1 and to `C` by the new $12 \Omega$ resistor). Node `C` also has a degree of 2 (connected to `B` by $12 \Omega$ and to `D` by R4). The `_simplify_series` method identifies that `A-B` (R1=10) is in series with `B-C` (12 $\Omega$) because node `B` is intermediate with degree 2. It removes `B`, R1, the $12 \Omega$ resistor, and adds a new resistor of $10 + 12 = 22 \Omega$ between `A` and `C`. `made_reduction` is True.
        * **Iteration 3:** The loop restarts. Now, node `C` has a degree of 2 (connected to `A` by $22 \Omega$ and to `D` by R4=40). The `_simplify_series` method identifies this. It removes `C`, the $22 \Omega$ resistor, R4, and adds a new resistor of $22 + 40 = 62 \Omega$ between `A` and `D`. `made_reduction` is True.
        * **Iteration 4:** The loop restarts. The graph now consists of only nodes `A` and `D` connected by a single $62 \Omega$ resistor. The loop condition (`G has more than 1 edge AND G is not just terminal_A connected to terminal_B by one edge`) fails, or the `if len(edges_between_terminals) == 1 and self.G.number_of_nodes() == 2` condition is met. The algorithm returns $62.0 \Omega$.

2.  **Wheatstone Bridge Example:**
    * **Circuit:** A classic Wheatstone bridge.
    * **Terminals:** A and D.
    * **How it handles:**
        * The algorithm starts. It attempts parallel reduction. There are no direct parallel resistors (e.g., two resistors directly between A and B).
        * It attempts series reduction. No intermediate node (like B or C) has a degree of exactly 2, because of the cross-branch resistor (B-C). For example, node B is connected to A, D, and C (degree 3). Node C is connected to A, D, and B (degree 3).
        * Since neither `_simplify_parallel` nor `_simplify_series` returns `True` in any iteration, `made_a_reduction` remains `False`. The `while` loop breaks.
        * The final check `if len(edges_between_terminals) == 1 and self.G.number_of_nodes() == 2:` fails because there are still multiple nodes and edges.
        * The algorithm correctly returns "Circuit cannot be fully reduced by series/parallel rules. Remaining edges/nodes present." This demonstrates its limitation to only series/parallel reducible circuits.

3.  **Complex Graph with "Dead Ends" (Implicit in the ladder example):**
    * **Circuit:** (Imagine a simple ladder: A-R1-B, A-R3-D, B-R4-E, D-R6-E, B-R2-C, C-R5-F, E-R7-F)
    * **Terminals:** A and F
    * **How it handles (conceptual example):**
        If there's a part of the circuit that is not connected to the path between the terminals, or forms a branch that leads to a dead end (a node with degree 1 not being a terminal), the algorithm will generally ignore it.
        For example, if we had `A --R1-- B` and then `X --R2-- Y` in a separate part of the graph, and we ask for `A-B` equivalent resistance, the `X-Y` part won't be touched.
        If a resistor connects to the main path but then leads to a dead-end, the algorithm won't simplify that dead-end path unless it becomes part of a series/parallel segment through other reductions. Our current series reduction explicitly avoids reducing terminal nodes. If a non-terminal node forms a dead end that is also not degree 2, it will just remain in the graph if it doesn't participate in a series/parallel reduction. The outcome for `A-F` would still be `Circuit cannot be fully reduced` if the path doesn't simplify entirely. The test case for "No path" explicitly shows this: A-B and C-D are two separate circuits. If terminals are A and C, it cannot reduce.

#### Brief Analysis of the Algorithm's Efficiency and Potential Improvements:

**Efficiency:**

* **Time Complexity:** The algorithm is iterative. In each iteration, it scans through nodes for series connections and pairs of nodes for parallel connections.
    * **Parallel Reduction:** Iterating through all pairs of nodes $(u, v)$ takes $O(N^2)$ where $N$ is the number of nodes. Retrieving edges and summing resistances for parallel connections takes $O(E)$ in the worst case (if all edges are between two nodes), where $E$ is the number of edges. Adding/removing edges/nodes in `networkx` generally takes about $O(1)$ for simple cases or $O(log N)$ for more complex underlying data structures.
    * **Series Reduction:** Iterating through nodes takes $O(N)$. Checking degree and finding neighbors takes $O(degree)$ for each node. Removing nodes/edges is efficient.
    * The worst-case number of iterations is not trivial to pin down, as one reduction can lead to another. In theory, for a graph with $N$ nodes and $E$ edges, each reduction reduces the number of edges/nodes. A simple upper bound might be $O(E)$ iterations.
    * Overall, a naive analysis would suggest something like $O(Iterations \times (N^2 + E))$ or $O(E \times (N^2 + E))$ in the worst case. This means the algorithm's efficiency will degrade for very large and dense graphs.

* **Space Complexity:** $O(N+E)$ to store the graph.

**Potential Improvements:**

1.  **Optimization of Iteration:** Instead of restarting the entire scan (`return made_reduction` and `continue`) after *every* reduction, one could try to identify all parallel/series reductions in a single pass of an iteration and then apply them. However, applying one reduction might create new opportunities that the current pass misses, so multiple passes within a major iteration might still be needed. A more sophisticated approach would be to maintain a queue of "potentially reducible" nodes/edges.
2.  **Handling Wheatstone Bridges (Y-Δ Transformations):** The most significant limitation of this algorithm is its inability to solve non-series/parallel reducible circuits like Wheatstone bridges. To address this, the algorithm could be extended to include Y-Δ (Wye-Delta) or Δ-Y transformations. These transformations allow converting certain non-series/parallel segments into equivalent forms that *might* then become series/parallel reducible. This would drastically increase the power of the algorithm but also its complexity.
3.  **Efficiency for Large Graphs:** For extremely large circuits, specialized graph algorithms or matrix-based circuit analysis (e.g., nodal analysis, modified nodal analysis) are generally more efficient. The graph theory approach here is intuitive and educational for understanding reductions but might not be the fastest for industrial-scale circuit simulation.
4.  **Error Handling for Disconnected Graphs:** The current code implicitly handles disconnected components if the terminals are within one connected component. If terminals are in different components, it will correctly report no reduction.
5.  **Directed vs. Undirected:** This implementation assumes undirected edges, suitable for simple resistors. For circuits with diodes or active components, a directed graph approach would be needed.

In conclusion, this graph-theory-based algorithm provides a clear and effective way to calculate equivalent resistance for circuits reducible by series and parallel rules. Its iterative nature gracefully handles nested combinations. While efficient for moderately complex reducible circuits, extending it to general networks would require incorporating more advanced graph transformation techniques.
