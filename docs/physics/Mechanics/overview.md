# Mechanics Overview

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion and behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements. It is broadly divided into kinematics (describing motion) and dynamics (explaining motion based on forces).

## Key Concepts
* Newton's Laws of Motion
* Work, Energy, and Power
* Momentum and Collisions
* Rotational Motion
* Simple Harmonic Motion
