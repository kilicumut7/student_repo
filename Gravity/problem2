# Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

---

## Motivation

Escape velocity and cosmic velocities are critical concepts in astrophysics and space exploration. They determine the minimum speeds required for a spacecraft or object to:

* Stay in orbit around a celestial body.
* Escape its gravitational pull.
* Leave the gravitational influence of a star system.

Understanding these speeds guides mission planning, satellite launches, and interplanetary travel.

## 1. Definitions of Cosmic Velocities

* **First Cosmic Velocity** ($v_1$) — *Orbital velocity*:

  Minimum speed needed for a circular orbit just above the surface of a celestial body (e.g., Earth). At this speed, the centrifugal force balances gravity.

* **Second Cosmic Velocity** ($v_2$) — *Escape velocity*:

  Minimum speed to escape a celestial body’s gravity completely without further propulsion.

* **Third Cosmic Velocity** ($v_3$) — *Solar system escape velocity*:

  Speed required to escape the gravitational pull of the star system (e.g., the Sun) starting from the celestial body’s surface.

## 2. Mathematical Derivations

Given:

* $G$ — gravitational constant
* $M$ — mass of the celestial body
* $R$ — radius of the celestial body
* $M_s$ — mass of the star (e.g., the Sun)
* $R_s$ — orbital radius of the celestial body around the star (e.g., Earth-Sun distance)

### First Cosmic Velocity ($v_1$):

For circular orbit near surface,

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

---

### Second Cosmic Velocity ($v_2$):

Escape speed from the surface,

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1
$$

---

### Third Cosmic Velocity ($v_3$):

Escape speed from the star system starting from the surface of the planet, approximately:

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{\text{orb}}^2}
$$

where $v_{\text{orb}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM_s}{R_s}}$ is the orbital speed of the planet around the star.

Simplified (assuming escape from star system requires overcoming both planet and star gravity):

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{2GM_s/R_s + 2GM/R}
$$

Practically, escape velocity from the star system combines the escape velocity from the planet and the orbital velocity around the star.

## 4. Importance in Space Exploration

* **First cosmic velocity:** To launch satellites into stable orbit.
* **Second cosmic velocity:** To send spacecraft escaping Earth’s gravity (e.g., Moon missions).
* **Third cosmic velocity:** To leave the solar system, e.g., Voyager probes.
